<h1>Not Yet Configured</h1>
<p>You have not yet configured any Flows or Libraries.</p><br/>

<h2>Step 1. Creating a Flow </h2>
<p>To use FileFlows a Flow must first be created.</p>
<p>A Flow can be thought of as a processing rule that is run against files.</p>
<p>You can have as many Flows as you like, ranging from many tasks.</p>
<p>For example, you can configure a Flow to convert video files from one format into another. Or a Flow to move pictures into folders based on the date they were taken.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Step 2. Creating a Library</h2>
<p>FileFlows needs one or more Libraries to monitor for files.</p>
<p>These can be directories or drives.</p>
<p>You can configure filters on a Library to only look for certain types of files, e.g. Movies or Pictures.</p>
